These are iOS lock screen widgets (using Scriptables(https://scriptable.app/)), you can use it as a normal widget also.

#### Variables to configure


You need to put a value for `openweather_api_key` variable in `weather`, `wind`, `sun` widgets.

You can create one from here https://openweathermap.org/api

#### To customize

Since these are lock screen widgets, you can change color of these widgets, like how you change the clock color.

In widget scripts, you can change `font_size`, based on your screen size if it is unsuitable.


#### Note

I tested this on my iPhone with the iOS 18 beta version, feel free to raise issues if you face any.
